# Fault-Detection-and-Response-using-RTOS-and-FFT

Fault detection using Fast Fourier Transform of the audio input and ultrasound sensor. The FFT was taken after performing windowing operation (Hamming). An appropriate response was taken using stepper motors and LEDs. Events were scheduled using FreeRTOS. 

# Demo 

A demo video is given in the repository for practical demo (explained in Urdu/Hindi).
